Quality of life fixes for Tabroom.com.
- Adds a tournament home button on the results page.
- Makes it so that you don't open a new tab when clicking on results or tournament pages
- Adds a quick link to google your judge
- Adds a button to reveal competitor names instead of numbers on the Pairings page (look on the top right next to the print button!)
